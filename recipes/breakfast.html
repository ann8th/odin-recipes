    <h2>the story</h2>
    <p>At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.</p>
    <p><em>"This porridge is too hot!"</em> she exclaimed.</p>
    <p>So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl.</p>
    <p><em>"This porridge is too cold,"</em> she said.</p> 
    <p>So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge.</p> 
    <p><em>"Ahhh, this porridge is just right,"</em> she said happily and she ate it all up."</p>
    <p>(from The Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears)</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered milk</li>
        <li>1½ cups rolled oats </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Combine the powdered milk, oats and cinnamon; quickly stir into the boiling water. Return the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture is the desired thickness.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove from heat and mix in the raisins and vanilla. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. The hot porridge will cook the eggs completely. Divide the porridge between 4 bowls. Top each one with a teaspoon of butter, 1/4 cup of milk , and drizzle with honey.</li>
    </ol>
