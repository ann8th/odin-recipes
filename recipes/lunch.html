    <h2>the story</h2>
    <p><em>"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating,"</em> said the Queen presently. <em>"What would you like best to eat?"</em></p>
    <p><em>“Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty,”</em> said Edmund.</p>
    <p>The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.</p>
    <p>(from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, by C.S. Lewis)</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or to taste</li>
        <li>1⅔ cups cold water, divided</li>
        <li>7 teaspoons unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>2⅓ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons strained fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons rose water</li>
        <li>2 drops red food coloring</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease an 8-inch square pan with vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Place 2/3 cup water in a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin on top; let stand until softened, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining 1 cup water, sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil syrup, covered, for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover saucepan and attach a candy thermometer to the side; continue cooking syrup until the temperature reaches 238 degrees F (114 degrees C), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in gelatin mixture carefully until completely dissolved. Mix in rose water and red food coloring.</li>
        <li>Pour syrup into the greased pan. Let stand at room temperature until gelled, about 4 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and chill, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Cut gelled mixture into 1-inch squares. Dust with cornstarch.</li>
    </ol>
