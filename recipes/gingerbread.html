            <h2>the story</h2>
            <p>When they got closer, they could not believe their eyes!  If you can imagine – from top to bottom the hut was made all of candy!  From its gingerbread roof, with frosting all over the walls, and with candies tucked into the frosting, what a sight to see!</p>
            <p><em>“Gretel!”</em> Hansel cried out. Before Gretel could say: <em>“I bet it will be okay if we have just a little taste,”</em> both of them were already biting off small chunks and licking the sweet candy.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground dried ginger</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>¼ cup molasses</li>
                <li>1½ cups water</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, and cinnamon in a bowl; set aside. Beat the egg in a separate mixing bowl with the vanilla and molasses until smooth. Whisk in the water until completely incorporated. Stir the flour mixture into the molasses mixture until just combined -- a few lumps are okay.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
