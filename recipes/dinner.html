    <h2>the story</h2>
    <p>When they got closer, they could not believe their eyes!  If you can imagine – from top to bottom the hut was made all of candy!  From its gingerbread roof, with frosting all over the walls, and with candies tucked into the frosting, what a sight to see!</p>
    <p><em>“Gretel!”</em> Hansel cried out. Before Gretel could say: <em>“I bet it will be okay if we have just a little taste,”</em> both of them were already biting off small chunks and licking the sweet candy.</p>
    <p>(from The Story of Hansel and Gretel, by Wilhelm Grimm)</p>
